talon-web-api
=====

Mailgun library (https://github.com/mailgun/talon) to extract message quotations and signatures hosted as web-api in a docker container.

If you ever tried to parse message quotations or signatures you know that absence of any formatting standards in this area could make this task a nightmare. Hopefully this library will make your life much easier. The name of the project is inspired by TALON - multipurpose robot designed to perform missions ranging from reconnaissance to combat and operate in a number of hostile environments. Thatâ€™s what a good quotations and signature parser should be like :smile:

Usage
-----

Talon can be used as a webservice. Can be invoked by using the script.



``` 
./run-web.sh
```

Or via docker

```
./build-dock.sh
./run-dock.sh
```
